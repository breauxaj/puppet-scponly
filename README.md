scponly
=======

scponly is an alternative 'shell' (of sorts) for system administrators who would
like to provide access to remote users to both read and write local files
without providing any remote execution priviledges. Functionally, it is best
described as a wrapper to the tried and true ssh suite of applications.

Samples
-------
```
include scponly
```
